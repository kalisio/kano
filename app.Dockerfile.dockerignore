# This is the dockerignore used by app.Dockerfile, it filters out
# everything we don't want in the 'COPY . /opt/kalisio' step where
# '.' is the workspace folder.
# Since we expect the workspace to be clean, we don't allowlist
# specific folders, we copy everyhting but the following :

# Ignore all these
development/*
**/node_modules
**/npm-debug.log
**/*Dockerfile
**/docker-compose*
**/*dockerignore
**/.git
**/.gitignore
